      <h2>PRECAUTION IS BETTER THAN CURE</h2>


      <p>Let us see some home remedies for various diseases
          <br>
          Fever
          A person has a fever if their body temperature rises above the normal range of 98–100°F (36–37°C). It is a common sign of an infection.
          When someone has a fever, they may also:

shiver and feel cold when nobody else does
sweat
have a low appetite
show signs of dehydration
have increased sensitivity to pain
lack energy and feel sleepy
have difficulty concentrating

If a baby has a fever, they may:

feel hot to the touch
have flushed cheeks
be sweaty or clammy

There are several things an adult can do to feel more comfortable when they have a fever. These include:

Drinking lots of fluids
During a fever, the body needs to use more water to compensate for its elevated temperature. This can lead to dehydration.

Drinking water or an electrolyte replacement drink can help rehydrate the body.

Resting
Fighting an infection takes a lot of energy. People should rest as much as possible to help the body recover.

Taking a tepid bath
Many people consider taking a cold bath when they have a fever. However, doing so can cause shivering, which will increase body temperature even more.

Instead, people can take a lukewarm or tepid bath to help the body cool off. A bath can also help soothe tired muscles.

Using over-the-counter medications
Medications are not usually necessary to treat a fever. However, some over-the-counter (OTC) medications can help reduce a fever and make a person feel more comfortable. These medications include:

ibuprofen
acetaminophen
naproxen
Dressing lightly
Having a fever can cause a person to feel hot one minute and cold the next. Wearing too many layers can trap heat against the body, raising body temperature further.

People should wear few layers and add more if they start to feel cold.

Drinking plenty of fluids
Like adults, children with a fever also need plenty of fluids. However, it can be difficult to get young children to drink extra water.

Some more appealing alternatives include:

warm chicken broth
popsicles
flavored jello
diluted fruit juice
Resting
Children may feel better after taking OTC medications. As a result, they may feel more energetic and playful.

However, it is important to ensure that children rest until the fever or illness has passed.

If a child cannot sleep or relax, parents and caregivers can try reading them a story or playing them some gentle music.

Here is a remedy for fever.

COLD & COUGH

The common cold is medically referred to as a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Symptoms of the common cold may include cough, sore throat, low-grade fever, nasal congestion, runny nose, and sneezing.

Ginger tea not only tastes good but also helps in treating common cold and cough. The tea helps in drying running and dripping nose, thus expelling phlegm from the respiratory tract. Among various health benefits of ginger, it is known to soothe common cold and speeds up the recovery process.
Mixture of lemon, cinnamon and honey
Another effective home remedy for common cold and cough is a mixture of lemon, cinnamon and honey. This syrup effectively cures cold and cough.
How to make the syrup: In half spoon of honey, add a few drop of lemon and a pinch of cinnamon. Have this syrup twice a day to cure common cold and cough.
Luke-warm water
Drink luke-warm water frequently as it helps in fighting against common cold, cough and sore throat. Warm water reduces inflammation in the throat and helps in replenishing the fluids and infection out of the body.
Milk and turmeric
An essential ingredient found in almost all Indian kitchens, turmeric has a strong antioxidant which helps in treating many health problems. Turmeric mixed in warm milk is a popular and effective way to fight against cold and cough. Drinking a glass of warm turmeric milk before sleeping helps in faster recovery from cold and cough.
Gargle with salt-water
This is an age-old therapy that effectively treats cough and cold. Adding turmeric in this salt-water is also beneficial.
Honey and brandy
Brandy is known to keep your chest warm as it increases body’s temperature and missing honey in brandy helps in fighting a cough. Just a teaspoon of brandy mixed with few drops of honey improves cough and common cold.
Spiced tea
Add tulsi, ginger and black pepper while peparing your tea and this spiced tea is great for your health. These three ingredients play an important role in fighting a common cold and cough.
Honey, lime juice and warm water
This is a perfect dose to improve digestion and for the circulation system. Adding honey to luke-lime water is the best solution in controlling common cold and cough.
Vitamin C
There are some pieces of evidence that suggest that taking Vitamin C before the onset of cold symptoms may shorten the duration of symptoms. It may help to boost your immune health and can provide some relief from upper respiratory tract infections. Taking Vitamin C rich food like lemon, oranges and grapefruits are quite effective.
Zinc
Study shows that taking zinc supplements can help from getting sick. Zinc can help to boost the immunity that can reduce the symptoms of cold and even prevent you from falling sick. So when you are sick eat Zinc rich food like oysters, meat, chicken, dark chocolate, sunflower seeds and others.
